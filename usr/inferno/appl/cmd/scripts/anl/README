anl-lib.sh is the core library of all functions for interacting
with Argonne's surveyor machine.  It uses a configuration
file (/usr/$user/lib/anl.cfg) to personalize the scripts to
your particular setup.

Key enduser commands are:

anl-uplink - setup ssh tunnel to ANL and start remote inferno
		(this is necessary for all subsequent commands)
anl-cleanup - stop all threads on login node to cleanup
anl-run - execute Plan 9 on BG/P in development configuration
anl-debug - access JTAG debug console for running job
anl-del - cleanup running job
bgpio - get a CPU session on first IO Node
bgpcpu - get a CPU session on specified CPU node

There are helper scripts included which call them directly from
normal shells without using the library.
