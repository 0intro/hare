There appears to be several problems with the reservation mechanism.

First, nprocs is improperly calculated.  For the base node it should
be ncores or 1.  The top level gangfs should report the sum of all
below.  I probably need DSTS (-v 11) to see the stats change as
children register.

On the children, reslocal makes a reservation, and each subsequent
cloneproc makes one.  This ends up using the number of requested
reservations+1.  This is what is causing one of the segfault problems.

All the reservations are being sent to a single child (on the AMD
machine).  This needs to be confirmed on Intel and the BG.


On the master gang, the reservation request is setting up 2 gangs and
not4.
