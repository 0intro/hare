Some explanations on the OpenMP implementation of NPB 3.1 (NPB3.1-OMP)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

NPB-OMP is a sample OpenMP implementation based on NPB3.0-SER,
the serial version previously known as the Programming Baseline for NPB.
This implementation contains all nine benchmarks:
eight in Fortran: UA, BT, SP, LU, FT, CG, MG, and EP; one in C: IS.
There are two implementations of LU: a pipeline based (LU) and 
a hyperplane based (LU-HP) parallelization.

For changes from different versions, see the Changes.log file
included in the upper directory of this distribution.

This version has been tested, among others, on an SGI Origin3000 and
an IBM Power3.  For problem reports and suggestions on the implementation,

1. Compilation

   NPB3.1-OMP uses the same directory tree as NPB3.0-SER (and NPB2.x) does.
   Before compilation, one needs to check the configuration file
   'make.def' in the config directory and modify the file if necessary.  
   Check also the 'suite.def' file if one wants to make a suite.  Then

      make benchmark CLASS=class
   or
      make suite

   'benchmark' is one of (UA, BT, SP, LU, LU-HP, FT, CG, MG, EP, IS) and 
   'class' is one of (S, W, A, B, C, D), except that class D is not
   defined for IS.

2. Run

   NPB-OMP assumes static scheduling at run-time.  To ensure the
   correctness of the results, one can set the environment variable
   'OMP_SCHEDULE' to "static".
   For example in a csh:

      setenv OMP_SCHEDULE "static"
      setenv OMP_NUM_THREADS 4
      bin/BT.A > BT.A_out.4

   It runs BT Class A problem on 4 threads and the output is stored
   in BT.A_out.4.

   If one likes to profile a benchmark, the built-in timer can be used,
   which produces timing for selected code blocks.  The timer can be
   turned on by creating a dummy file 'timer.flag' in the current working
   directory (not necessary where the executable is located).

   The printed number of threads is the activated threads during the run,
   which may not be the same as what's requested.

3. Known issues

   For larger problem sizes, the default stack size for slave threads
   may need to be increased on certain platforms.  For example on SGI
   Origin 3000, the following command can be used:
      setenv MP_SLAVE_STACKSIZE 50000000 (to about 50MB)

   On SGI Altix using the Intel compiler, the runtime variable would be
      setenv KMP_STACKSIZE 50m  (for 50MB)

   For some buggy OpenMP compilers, you may have to play with 
   the optimization flag, for instance, use "-O2" over "-O3". 

4. Notes on the implementation

   - Based on NPB3.0-SER, except that FT which was kept closer to
     the original version in NPB2.3-serial.

   - OpenMP directives were added to the outer-most parallel loops.  No
     nested parallelism was considered.

   - Extra loops were added in the beginning of most of the benchmarks
     to touch data pages.  This is to set up a data layout based on the
     'first touch' policy.

   - For LU, both the pipeline algorithm and the hyperplane algorithm
     are included.

   - Unstructured Adaptive (UA) was not included in previous releases.
