This version contains a few minor improvements over NPB3.1-SER.
The detailed changes are included Changes.log in the upper directory. 
Compilation and run of the benchmarks are explained in README-3.0.  
Several new features and main improvements are listed here.  

Main changes from NPB3.1-SER:

   - Convert C++ version of DC to plain C.

   - A number of fixes in UA.

Main changes from NPB3.0-SER:

   - Include the Class D problem size in all benchmarks except for
     the IS benchmark.

   - Redefine the Class W problem size for MG to avoid too fast
     convergence.  The new size is 128x128x128, 4 iterations.

   - Use relative errors for verification in MG and CG, which is
     consistent with other benchmarks.

   - Include one SSOR iteration before the time step loop in both
     LU and LU-HP to touch all pages.

   - Include the UA benchmark

   - Include the DC benchmark
