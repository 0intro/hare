This is a modification of Larry McVoy's lmbench suite of benchmarks for use on Plan 9. lmbench is distributed under the GPL with the restriction that results from a modified version may not be published. Given that restriction, this benchmark should be used to make private measurements for use in optimization; barring permission from Larry McVoy or Carl Staelin, results obtained with this software should not be distributed.

To install:
	cd src
	mk all
	mk install #if you can write to /$objtype/bin
		OR
	mk installlocal #to install to $home/bin/$objtype/
	cd ..
	mkdir $home/bin/rc/lmbench
	cp scripts/* $home/bin/rc/lmbench

The scripts ending in _run will run individual benchmarks with various parameters and/or multiple times. The 9bench script will execute all the _run scripts one after another.
