.SH NAME
execfs \- execution initiation mechanism for proc 
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B execfs
[
.B -D
]
[
.I mnt
]

.B execcmd
[
.I srv-ctl
]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
execfs provides a clone file for the node's proc file system to
enable you to start applications via the file system namespace
(and therefor from remote nodes).
.PP
Every time the
.I clone
file is opened a new process is started and pipes for stdin, stdout and
stderr are bound into its
.IR proc (3)
entry.
It will snoop control messages sent to the open clone file descriptor
for commands it recognizes and pass others on to the ctl file of 
the placeholder process in 
.IR proc (3).

There is currently only a single command supported by 
.I execfs:
.RS
.TP
.B "exec $cmd $args"
will execute $cmd with $args as its arguments.
.RE
In the future additional commands may be added.
.PP
.I execcmd
is the proxy command initially run when the user opens clone.
It is passed a path to a pipe which has been posted in
.IR srv (3),
which is used to control commands form the initially opened
clone file.  It is not intended to be used in a stand-alone fashion.
