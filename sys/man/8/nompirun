.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B nompirun
and
.B wrapnompirun
are BASH wrapper scripts which can be run on the BG/P front-end nodes
to request execution of a new Plan 9 job.  The current environment expects either
an Inferno or Brasil instance to be serving a Plan 9 root file system from the front-end
nodes.  See
.IR deploybrasil (8)
and
.IR bgp-intro (8)
for more information on configuring your BG/P environment.

.PP
.B wrapnompirun
is a simple wrapper around
.B nompirun
which waits for execution of the job to begin and then relays
stdout and stderr from job execution.  stdout is typically the
output from the application while stderr is typically the output
from the various system consoles.  It doesn't do any special
checking for job termination, so you'll have to ^C it when finished.
.PP
Since these scripts only provide an interface to the underlying cobalt job submission
system, there may be some delay prior to job execution depending on scheduling
priorities and the number of jobs pending execution on the machine at any given
time.

scheduling system please see https://wiki.alcf.anl.gov/index.php/Using_the_ALCF_BG/P_System

.SH EXAMPLES

.RS
.I "nompirun -n 64 -t 30 testprog"
.RE
would schedule testprog to run 64 compute nodes for 30 minutes.

.RS
.I "wrapnompirun -n 64 -t 30 testprog"
.RE
would run testprog on 64 compute nodes for 30 minutes and print stdout and
stderr to the shell, blocking until the application gets scheduled.
