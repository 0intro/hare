.SH NAME
deploybrasil.sh \- wrapper script to start Inferno front-end for BG/P
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B deployBrasil.sh
[
.B -p port
]
[
.B -l path-to-hare-release
]
[
.B -f
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
This starts an Inferno instance which has been setup to provide file service access
to the front-end node from BG/P.  It must be run and provided with a per-user unique
port prior to dispatching any jobs to BG/P.
.PP
the
.I -p
argument specifies the user's unique port number.  The convention of using the user's
uid on the front-end system systems to work and provide uniqueness.
.PP
The
.I -I
argument specifies the path to the rest of the HARE binary distribution.  If no alternative
argument is given, the latest release stored in the argonne profiles directory is used.
.PP
The
.I -f
flag specifies starting inferno in the foreground instead of just running it as a daemon.
.SH BUGS
There is currently no automated cleanup of the Inferno processes on logout.  I'm in the habit
of running killall5 instead of just logging out which cleans up any outstanding processes I'm
running on the BG/P front-end node.
.PP
Its a good idea to restart Inferno between login sessions as a matter of housekeeping.
Depending on the size of the run, lots of file descriptors and other bits can consumed and
you start running into ulimits.  This should be something we can fix within Inferno (or
the way we are using it), but this hasn't been a priority.
