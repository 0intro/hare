.SH DESCRIPTION
The BG/P boot enviornment for Plan 9 at Argonne National
Labs consists of a few different parts.  It requires a kernel profile
which specifies (among other things) the kernel to boot on the
nodes, a front-end file server to allow access to user files, the root
file system, and application binaries, and a set of scripts which
help configure the Plan 9 instance running on the BG/P for a user
or application infrastructure.
.PP
The current convention is to keep binaries and scripts relating
to the execution of BG/P in a release directory stored with the
default Plan 9 kernel profile (/bgsys/argonne-utils/profiles/plan9).
A user may use the latest version of the scripts by putting the
profile's bin directory in their path.
.PP
In order to support private root file systems, each user is required
to have their own file server port.  The current convention is to use
the numeric user-id on the front-end node.  Once the port is
assigned and an Inferno file server started on the front-end node,
the user can request execution of Plan 9 jobs using the 
.IR nompirun (8) 
or wrapnompirun commands.
.PP
During boot, all nodes will execute a profile script from the user's
home directory on surveyor ($HOME/lib/profile).  This profile script
should contain default namespace setup for whatever enviornment
the user (or the application) desires.  A good example can be found
in the hare/usr/glenda/lib/profile script which attaches a caching
layer for the root file system and mounts binaries and the user's
home directory in standard locations.
