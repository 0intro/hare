.SH NAME
installHelp.sh \- Script copy all needed executables in proper place.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B installHelp.sh
[
.B -l path-to-hare-release
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Script installHelp.sh will copy the binaries/scripts in proper location,
so that executions of subsequent deployBrasil.sh and runJob.py are
location independent.  This script should be executed only once, and
can be considered as equivalent of  running make install

.PP
The
.I -I
argument specifies the path where the HARE binary distribution should be copied.  By default
/bgsys/argonne-utils/profiles/plan9/LATEST/bin/ path is used.  This path can be over-ridden
by either environment variable HARE_LOCATION or  command line argument -l.  The hare-path 
used in this command should be used as hare-path for commands deployBrasil and runJob.


.PP
installHelp copies the brasil, deployBrasil and runJob commands.  It should be executed after 
every succuessful compilation of the brasil or after modifications in deployBrasil.sh or runJob.py
scripts.

.PP
installHelp command should be executed from the same directory where the command is found
it the source code tree.  It relies on source code tree hierarchy for finding out other files.
If it is executed from other locations, it will not work.
