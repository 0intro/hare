                 programs by offering a multiplexed file service to
                 those clients. It serves traditional UNIX files like

                 provide access to the mouse and the raw screen. Bitmap
                 graphics operations are provided by serving a file
                 called {\tt /dev/bitblt} that interprets client
                 messages to perform raster operations. The file service
                 that $8 1/2$ offers its clients is identical to that it
                 uses for its own implementation, so it is fundamentally
                 no more than a multiplexer. This architecture has some

                 Plan 9 system comprises CPU and file servers in a

                 Slower networks fan out to workstation-class machines

                 support for the largest systems on a variety of

                 architectures: the vnode architecture found in SunOS,
                 the architecture used in the Sprite distributed file
                 system, and the architecture used in the Plan 9
                 distributed file system. The emphasis of the comparison
                 is on generalized support for remote access to file
                 system resources, which include peripheral devices and
                 IPC communication channels as well as regular files.
                 The vnode architecture is an evolution of structures
                 and interfaces used in the original, stand-alone UNIX
                 file system. The Sprite architecture provides a
                 network-wide shared name space and emphasizes a strong
                 separation of the internal naming and I/O interfaces to
                 easily provide remote access to a variety of resources.
                 The Plan 9 architecture relies on per-process name
                 spaces and is organized around a single file system
                 protocol, 9P, through which a variety of devices and
                 system services are accessed.",

                 gives text-oriented applications a clean, expressive,
                 and consistent style of interaction. Traditional window
                 systems support interactive client programs and offer
                 libraries of pre-defined operations such as pop-up
                 menus and buttons to promote a consistent user
                 interface among the clients. Acme instead provides its
                 clients with a fixed user interface and simple
                 conventions to encourage its uniform use. Clients
                 access the facilities of Acme through a file system
                 interface; Acme is in part a file server that exports
                 device-like files that may be manipulated to access and
                 control the contents of its windows. Written in a
                 concurrent programming language, Acme is structured as
                 a set of communicating processes that neatly subdivide
                 the various aspects of its tasks: display management,
                 input, file server, and so on.\par

                 Acme attaches distinct functions to the three mouse
                 buttons: the left selects text; the middle executes
                 textual commands; and the right combines context search
                 and file opening functions to integrate the various
                 applications and files in the system.\par

                 Acme works well enough to have developed a community
                 that uses it exclusively. Although Acme discourages the
                 traditional style of interaction based on typescript
                 windows teletypes its users find Acme's other services
                 render typescripts obsolete.",

  abstract =     "Plumbing is a new mechanism for inter-process
                 communication in Plan 9, specifically the passing of
                 messages between interactive programs as part of the
                 user interface. Although plumbing shares some
                 properties with familiar notions such as cut and paste,
                 it offers a more general data exchange mechanism
                 without imposing a particular user interface.\par

                 The core of the plumbing system is a program called the
                 plumber, which handles all messages and dispatches and
                 reformats them according to configuration rules written
                 in a special-purpose language. This approach allows the
                 contents and context of a piece of data to define how
                 it is handled. Unlike with drag and drop or cut and
                 paste, the user doesn't need to deliver the data; the
                 contents of a plumbing message, as interpreted by the
                 plumbing rules, determine its destination.\par

                 The plumber has an unusual architecture: it is a
                 language-driven file server. This design has distinct
                 advantages. It makes plumbing easy to add to an
                 existing, Unix-like command environment; it guarantees
                 uniform handling of inter-application messages; it
                 off-loads from those applications most of the work of
                 extracting and dispatching messages; and it works

                 the editor on a local host, with both processes on a
                 bitmap-equipped host, or with the display process in

                 system has recently been redesigned to address some
                 technical shortcomings. This redesign provided an
                 opportunity also to make the system more convenient to
                 use securely. Plan 9 has thus improved in two ways not

                 The central component of the new architecture is a
                 per-user self-contained agent called {\tt
                 factotum}. {\tt Factotum} securely holds a copy of the

                 identifier for read and write operations. This approach
                 enforces a write-once policy, preventing accidental or
                 malicious destruction of data. In addition, duplicate
                 copies of a block can be coalesced, reducing the
                 consumption of storage and simplifying the
                 implementation of clients. Venti is a building block
                 for constructing a variety of storage applications such
                 as logical backup, physical backup, and snapshot file
                 systems.\par

We describe our research goals in doing the work; the effort needed for the port; some of the unique aspects of Plan 9 and their application to BG/P networks; an MPI-like library we have developed for native Plan 9 programs on Blue Gene; and, finally, a\&nbsp;binary compatibility environment which can run Blue Gene Compute Node Kernel programs. We are currently working on bringing up the Linpack benchmark, with the goal of gaining a\&nbsp;place for Plan 9 on the Top 500 list.},
