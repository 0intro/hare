	is an order of magnitude more efficient to purchase and operate than
	the commodity clusters in use today. Driven by scientific computing
	demands the Blue Gene designers pursued an aggressive system-on-a-chip
	methodology that led to a scalable platform composed of air-cooled
	racks. Each rack contains more than a thousand independent computers
	with highspeed interconnects inside and between racks.},
