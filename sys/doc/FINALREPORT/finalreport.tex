This report documents the results of work done over a 6 year period under the FAST-OS 
programs. The first effort was called Right-Weight Kernels, (RWK) and was concerned with 
improving measurements of OS noise so it could be treated quantitatively; 
and evaluating the use of two operating systems, Linux
and Plan~9, on HPC systems and determining how these operating systems needed
to be extended or changed for HPC, while still retaining their general-purpose nature. 

The second program, HARE, explored the creation of alternative runtime models, 
building on RWK. All of the HARE work was done on Plan~9. 

The organizations included LANL (RWK) and Sandia (RWK, HARE), as the PI moved to Sandia; 
IBM; Bell Labs; and Vita Nuova, as a subcontractor to Bell Labs. In any given year, 
the funding was suffcient to cover a PI from each organization part time. 

Even given this limited funding, the two efforts had outsized impact: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Helped Cray decide to use Linux, instead of a custom kernel, and provided
the tools needed to make Linux perform well
\item Created a successor operating system to Plan~9, NIX, which has been taken in 
by Bell Labs for further development
\item Created a standard system measurement tool, Fixed Time Quantum or FTQ, which is widely
used for measuring operating systems impact on applications
\item Spurred the use of the 9p protocol in several organizations, including IBM
\item Built software in use at many companies, including IBM, Cray, and Google
\item Spurred the creation of alternative runtimes for use on HPC systems
\item Demonstrated that, with proper modifications, a general purpose operating systems
can provide communications up to 3 times as effective as user-level libraries
\end{itemize}

We describe details of these impacts in the following sections. The rest of this 
report is organized as follows: first, we describe commercial impact; next, 
we describe the FTQ benchmark and its impact in more detail; operating systems
and runtime research follows; we discuss infrastructure software; and close with a 
description of the new NIX  operating system, future work, and conclusions.

\chapter{Conclusions}

This work was done as part of the FAST-OS program and its successor. 
The ground was prepared for the FAST-OS programs in a series of meetings held in
the eary 2000s. One of the PIs earliest talks dates from 2002. In 2003, we made
the following arguments: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Linux is fun and working now; enjoy it
\item Linux is not forever
\item Some fundamental properties of the Unix model have fatal flaws
\item We are entering a period of “architecture flux” 
\item We need diversity in OS research now to prepare for new, strange machines
\item DOE can succeed in creating a successful, diverse OS research community
\end{itmemize}

We might ask: is any of this less true now that our community is faced with 
the challenge of scaling parallelism up 1000-fold? We would argue that 
the problem is even worse. While this program may have had successes, in some 
sense the community
still plowing the same ruts. The extant machines still largely run Linux, and the 
problems we predicted in 2003 (for the 2012 timeframe) are starting to 
come to pass: with each new version, Linux gets just a bit slower, as it grows in size 
and complexity and the processors do not get any faster. As we stated in 2003, 
``At some point, like all other OSes, it’s [Linux] going to fall over''. 
Several large companies, in private conversation, have told the PI that one of the
biggest management headaches they have is dealing with the increasing complexity of 
the Linux kernel, version to version. 

Did FAST-OS succeed? That is a harder question. In the sense of industry impact, we 
clearly had great success. In the sense of building a vibrant community of OS researchers
in DOE, we had some success; there is very good OS work going on at Argonne, Oak Ridge, 
and Sandia, and on a smaller scale, other Labs. 

Those are hard-won gains, and maintaining them 
will not be easy: OS research continues to come under 
pressure for both budget reasons and 
from those who believe that industry will just supply an OS as a turnkey 
answer, in spite of all historical evidence to the contrary. No standard OS has ever worked
for the large scale without substantial measurement and change. 

When FAST-OS started, the discussion was whether the DOE Labs would have any OS 
knowledge or capability left by the end of the decade. FAST-OS and its successor
program created a culture of competency in the DOE Labs and attracted some very 
capable collaboraters from outside the labs. 
In the end, we count this research, 
and the larger program that funded it, as a success. Whether
the gains we have made will be maintained is a question that can only 
be answered at the end of {\em this} decade.
