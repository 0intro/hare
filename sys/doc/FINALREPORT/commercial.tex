\section{Coraid}
Coraid is a fast-growing vendor of network disk systems used in cloud computing centers. 
Coraid uses the trace software we developed\cite{plan9trace} for Blue Gene. 
This software extends both the kernel and the linker to enable convenient, efficient 
performance tracing of kernel functions. A measure of the efficiency of this software 
is that  all of Coraid's production
kernels ship with the tracing software always installed and enabled. 
The capability provided by the software is so useful, and the performance impact so small, 
that Coraid decided that it should always be available.
