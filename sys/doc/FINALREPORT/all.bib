Although we stopped short of full internationalization for example, system error messages are in Unixese, not Japanese we believe Plan 9 is the first system to treat the representation of all major languages on a uniform, equal footing throughout all its software.},

	Abstract = {A hybrid of window system, shell, and editor, Acme gives text-oriented applications a clean, expressive, and consistent style of interaction. Traditional window systems support interactive client programs and offer libraries of pre-defined operations such as pop-up menus and buttons to promote a consistent user interface among the clients. Acme instead provides its clients with a fixed user interface and simple conventions to encourage its uniform use. Clients access the facilities of Acme through a file system interface; Acme is in part a file server that exports device-like files that may be manipulated to access and control the contents of its windows. Written in a concurrent programming language, Acme is structured as a set of communicating processes that neatly subdivide the various aspects of its tasks: display management, input, file server, and so on.\par Acme attaches distinct functions to the three mouse buttons: the left selects text; the middle executes textual commands; and the right combines context search and file opening functions to integrate the various applications and files in the system.\par Acme works well enough to have developed a community that uses it exclusively. Although Acme discourages the traditional style of interaction based on typescript windows teletypes its users find Acme's other services render typescripts obsolete.},

@inproceedings{Pike:2000:LFNb,
	Abstract = {Symbolic links make the Unix file system non-hierarchical, resulting in multiple valid path names for a given file. This ambiguity is a source of confusion, especially since some shells work overtime to present a consistent view from programs such as {\tt pwd}, while other programs and the kernel itself do nothing about the problem.\par Plan 9 has no symbolic links but it does have other mechanisms that produce the same difficulty. Moreover, Plan 9 is founded on the ability to control a program s environment by manipulating its name space. Ambiguous names muddle the result of operations such as copying a name space across the network.\par To address these problems, the Plan 9 kernel has been modified to maintain an accurate path name for every active file (open file, working directory, mount table entry) in the system. The definition of accurate is that the path name for a file is guaranteed to be the rooted, absolute name the program used to acquire it. These names are maintained by an efficient method that combines lexical processing such as evaluating {\tt ..} by just removing the last path name element of a directory with local operations within the file system to maintain a consistently, easily understood view of the name system. Ambiguous situations are resolved by examining the lexically maintained names themselves.\par A new kernel call, {\tt fd2path}, returns the file name associated with an open file, permitting the use of reliable names to improve system services ranging from {\tt pwd} to debugging. Although this work was done in Plan 9, Unix systems could also benefit from the addition of a method to recover the accurate name of an open file or the current directory.},

@inproceedings{Cox:2002:SP9,
	Abstract = {The security architecture of the Plan 9 operating system has recently been redesigned to address some technical shortcomings. This redesign provided an opportunity also to make the system more convenient to use securely. Plan 9 has thus improved in two ways not usually seen together: it has become more secure {\em and\/} easier to use.\par The central component of the new architecture is a per-user self-contained agent called {\tt factotum}. {\tt Factotum} securely holds a copy of the user's keys and negotiates authentication protocols, on behalf of the user, with secure services around the network. Concentrating security code in a single program offers several advantages including: ease of update or repair to broken security software and protocols; the ability to run secure services at a lower privilege level; uniform management of keys for all services; and an opportunity to provide single sign on, even to unchanged legacy applications. {\tt Factotum} has an unusual architecture: it is implemented as a Plan 9 file server.},

	Abstract = {The Plan 9 window system, $8 1/2$, is a modest-sized program of novel design. It provides textual I/O and bitmap graphic services to both local and remote client programs by offering a multiplexed file service to those clients. It serves traditional UNIX files like {\tt /dev/tty} as well as more unusual ones that provide access to the mouse and the raw screen. Bitmap graphics operations are provided by serving a file called {\tt /dev/bitblt} that interprets client messages to perform raster operations. The file service that $8 1/2$ offers its clients is identical to that it uses for its own implementation, so it is fundamentally no more than a multiplexer. This architecture has some rewarding symmetries and can be implemented compactly.},

	Abstract = {Plan 9 is a distributed system built at the Computing Sciences Research Center of AT\&T Bell Laboratories (now Lucent Technologies, Bell Labs) over the last few years. Its goal is to provide a production-quality system for software development and general computation using heterogeneous hardware and minimal software. A Plan 9 system comprises CPU and file servers in a central location connected together by fast networks. Slower networks fan out to workstation-class machines that serve as user terminals. Plan 9 argues that given a few carefully implemented abstractions it is possible to produce a small operating system that provides support for the largest systems on a variety of architectures and networks. The foundations of the system are built on two ideas: a per-process name space and a simple message-oriented file system protocol.},

	Abstract = {This paper compares three distributed file system architectures: the vnode architecture found in SunOS, the architecture used in the Sprite distributed file system, and the architecture used in the Plan 9 distributed file system. The emphasis of the comparison is on generalized support for remote access to file system resources, which include peripheral devices and IPC communication channels as well as regular files. The vnode architecture is an evolution of structures and interfaces used in the original, stand-alone UNIX file system. The Sprite architecture provides a network-wide shared name space and emphasizes a strong separation of the internal naming and I/O interfaces to easily provide remote access to a variety of resources. The Plan 9 architecture relies on per-process name spaces and is organized around a single file system protocol, 9P, through which a variety of devices and system services are accessed.},

	Abstract = {Symbolic links make the Unix file system non-hierarchical, resulting in multiple valid path names for a given file. This ambiguity is a source of confusion, especially since some shells work overtime to present a consistent view from programs such as {\tt pwd}, while other programs and the kernel itself do nothing about the problem.\par Plan 9 has no symbolic links but it does have other mechanisms that produce the same difficulty. Moreover, Plan 9 is founded on the ability to control a program s environment by manipulating its name space. Ambiguous names muddle the result of operations such as copying a name space across the network.\par To address these problems, the Plan 9 kernel has been modified to maintain an accurate path name for every active file (open file, working directory, mount table entry) in the system. The definition of accurate is that the path name for a file is guaranteed to be the rooted, absolute name the program used to acquire it. These names are maintained by an efficient method that combines lexical processing such as evaluating {\tt ..} by just removing the last path name element of a directory with local operations within the file system to maintain a consistently, easily understood view of the name system. Ambiguous situations are resolved by examining the lexically maintained names themselves.\par A new kernel call, {\tt fd2path}, returns the file name associated with an open file, permitting the use of reliable names to improve system services ranging from {\tt pwd} to debugging. Although this work was done in Plan 9, Unix systems could also benefit from the addition of a method to recover the accurate name of an open file or the current directory.},

	Abstract = {Plumbing is a new mechanism for inter-process communication in Plan 9, specifically the passing of messages between interactive programs as part of the user interface. Although plumbing shares some properties with familiar notions such as cut and paste, it offers a more general data exchange mechanism without imposing a particular user interface.\par The core of the plumbing system is a program called the plumber, which handles all messages and dispatches and reformats them according to configuration rules written in a special-purpose language. This approach allows the contents and context of a piece of data to define how it is handled. Unlike with drag and drop or cut and paste, the user doesn't need to deliver the data; the contents of a plumbing message, as interpreted by the plumbing rules, determine its destination.\par The plumber has an unusual architecture: it is a language-driven file server. This design has distinct advantages. It makes plumbing easy to add to an existing, Unix-like command environment; it guarantees uniform handling of inter-application messages; it off-loads from those applications most of the work of extracting and dispatching messages; and it works transparently across a network.},

	Abstract = {The Plan 9 window system, $8 1/2$, is a modest-sized program of novel design. It provides textual I/O and bitmap graphic services to both local and remote client programs by offering a multiplexed file service to those clients. It serves traditional UNIX files like {\tt /dev/tty} as well as more unusual ones that provide access to the mouse and the raw screen. Bitmap graphics operations are provided by serving a file called {\tt /dev/bitblt} that interprets client messages to perform raster operations. The file service that $8 1/2$ offers its clients is identical to that it uses for its own implementation, so it is fundamentally no more than a multiplexer. This architecture has some rewarding symmetries and can be implemented compactly.},

	Abstract = {Sam is an interactive multi-file text editor intended for bitmap displays. A textual command language supplements the mouse-driven, cut-and-paste interface to make complex or repetitive editing tasks easy to specify. The language is characterized by the composition of regular expressions to describe the structure of the text being modified. The treatment of files as a database, with changes logged as atomic transactions, guides the implementation and makes a general `undo' mechanism straightforward.\par Sam is implemented as two processes connected by a low-bandwidth stream, one process handling the display and the other the editing algorithms. Therefore it can run with the display process in a bitmap terminal and the editor on a local host, with both processes on a bitmap-equipped host, or with the display process in the terminal and the editor in a remote host. By suppressing the display process, it can even run without a bitmap terminal.\par This paper is reprinted from {\em Software Practice and Experience}, Vol 17, number 11, pp. 813--845, November 1987. The paper has not been updated for the Plan 9 manuals. Although Sam has not changed much since the paper was written, the system around it certainly has. Nonetheless, the description here still stands as the best introduction to the editor.},

This approach enforces a write-once policy, preventing accidental or malicious destruction of data. In addition, duplicate copies of a block can be coalesced, reducing the consumption of storage and simplifying the implementation of clients. Venti is a building block for constructing a variety of storage applications such as logical backup, physical backup, and snapshot file systems.\par We have built a prototype of the system and present some preliminary performance results. The system uses magnetic disks as the storage technology, resulting in an access time for archival data that is comparable to non-archival data. The feasibility of the write-once model for storage is demonstrated using data from over a decade's use of two Plan 9 file systems.},

	Abstract = {In Linux, applications like su and login currently run as root in order to access authentication information and set or alter the identity of the process. In such cases, if the application is compromised while running as a privileged user, the entire system can become vulnerable. An alternative approach is taken by the Plan 9 operating system from Bell Labs, which runs such applications as a non-privileged user and relies on a kernel-based capability device working in coordination with an authentication server to provide the same services. This avoids the risk of an application vulnerability becoming a system vulnerability.\par This paper discusses the extension of Linux authentication mechanisms to allow the use of the Plan 9 approach with existing Linux applications in order to reduce the security risks mentioned earlier. It describes the port of the Plan 9 capability device as a character device driver for the Linux kernel. It also describes the port of the Plan 9 authentication server and the implementation of a PAM module which allows the use of these new facilities. {\em It is now possible to restrain processes like login and su from the uncontrolled setuid bit and make them run on behalf of an unprivileged user in Linux}.},

	Abstract = {Numerous systems have been designed which use virtualization to subdivide the ample resources of a modern computer. Some require specialized hardware, or cannot support commodity operating systems. Some target 100\% binary compatibility at the expense of performance. Others sacrifice security or functionality for speed. Few offer resource isolation or performance guarantees; most provide only best-effort provisioning, risking denial of service.This paper presents Xen, an x86 virtual machine monitor which allows multiple commodity operating systems to share conventional hardware in a safe and resource managed fashion, but without sacrificing either performance or functionality. This is achieved by providing an idealized virtual machine abstraction to which operating systems such as Linux, BSD and Windows XP, can be ported with minimal effort.Our design is targeted at hosting up to 100 virtual machine instances simultaneously on a modern server. The virtualization approach taken by Xen is extremely efficient: we allow operating systems such as Linux and Windows XP to be hosted simultaneously for a negligible performance overhead --- at most a few percent compared with the unvirtualized case. We considerably outperform competing commercial and freely available solutions in a range of microbenchmarks and system-wide tests.},
